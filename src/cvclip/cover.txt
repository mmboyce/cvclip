# Welcome to CVClip!
#
# You do not need to remove these lines that begin with "#", as these are comments!
# Any line after this block of lines with "#" that begins with "#" won't be ignored though.
#
# -----------How To Use-----------
# This file is your cover letter template!
# All you have to do is place your usual cover letter,
# and any time you want to insert the name of the company, write "$CT" without the quotations!
# Likewise, whenever you want to insert the position's title, write "$PT" without the quotations.
#
# $PT - placeholder for position title
# $CT - placeholder for company title
#
# For any further information, refer to the README on the project's github!

To Whom It May Concern,

This is an example of a cover letter. I'd really like to apply to the $PT opening at $CT.
Please hire me!

Best,
A Strong Candidate

P.S.
Hope this helps!
